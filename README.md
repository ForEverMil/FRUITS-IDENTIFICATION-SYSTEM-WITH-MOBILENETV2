# FRUITS-IDENTIFICATION-SYSTEM-WITH-MOBILENETV2
The system builds and develops a system capable of accurately recognizing and classifying popular fruits. With the advancement of deep learning and deep neural networks, fruit identification will bring widespread applications in practice.
The model has been trained and recognizes 10 types of fruit with a relatively high accuracy of 98%, although the amount of data will still be limited. The model using MobileNetV2 has good learning and implementation value if developed into a software. Application to identify many different types of fruit, but requires a lot of dataset.
